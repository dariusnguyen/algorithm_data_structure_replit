'''
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. For simplicity, assume the linked list cannot have more than 1000 nodes in it.

Examples:
Linked List with values in order 3,2,0,4 and pointer from 4 to 2
	This linked list would return True

single linked list with value of 1
	This linked list would return False


Apply Floyd's cycle detection algorithm:
	fast and slow pointers
	loop through nodes in list
		if fast == slow
